                    <h2 class="aboutHeader">Vision</h2>

                    <p id="newsContent">Our vision is of a world in which trade
                    is democratized; where all countries have both equal access
                    to global markets and an equal capacity to leverage that
                    access to grow their economies, feed their peoples, and end
                    poverty. It is with this second aspect – leveraging access
                    – that we believe we can help.</p>
                    
                    <hr>   

                    <h2 class="aboutHeader">Mission</h2>

                    <p id="newsContent">Currently, many developing low and
                    middle income countries have legal access to global markets
                    either through free-trade agreements or through some form
                    of favoured nation status with wealthier nations.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, legal access is <b>not enough</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Developing countries and their economies often lack the
                    resources to leverage this legal access. They lack the
                    efficient communication and transport infrastructure to
                    keep costs down while domestic businesses – usually micro-,
                    small-, or medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) – individually
                    lack the size or scale necessary to realize the cost
                    advantages of the economies of scale available to the
                    developed world’s large companies and economies. With the
                    cost barrier in place, few of these MSMEs ship goods out.
                    The lack of frequency of exports drives up the costs of
                    shipping goods both into and out of the country. The high
                    cost barrier is reinforced, and it becomes a self-defeating
                    loop.<br>
                    <br>
                    Improving the internal communication and transportation
                    logistics of a developing country will lead to rapid
                    advancements in its economic growth, its ability to deliver
                    public services, and its ability to take advantage of
                    global trade for the benefit of its people.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our mission is to deliver the ShippingHub National
                    Logistics Strategy (SNLS) with the goal of assisting low
                    and middle income countries in leveraging their access to
                    global markets. The Strategy consists of a suite of
                    technology and organization solutions designed to spur
                    economic development and to reduce hunger and poverty. By
                    implementing logistic solutions that will boost
                    efficiencies associated with the movement of goods, we will
                    lower the cost barriers currently blocking access to these
                    markets.</p>
