            <h1>Trip Report - Kingston, Jamaica - July, 2014</h1>
            <h2>Posted July 21, 2014</h2>

            <p>We had a very successful business trip to Kingston, Jamaica (July 9 - July 18).</p>

            <p>On July 9th, 2014, we arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, to begin our string of meetings with ministries, private sector                          organizations, and higher learning institutions. Our primary objective was to receive feedback on the ShippingHub National                    Logistic Strategy (SNLS) and to receive their official support via written endorsements. We are delighted to report that our                  trip was an astounding success, going beyond our objectives.</p>

            <p>Both the ministries and private sector organizations agreed to officially support us with written endorsements. They believe                  the National Logistic Strategy will address many of the challenges that plague Jamaicaâ€™s economy. These difficulties include                  lack of domestic imports, lack of exports, perishable crops, and inefficient infrastructure. They recognized that our                        innovative technology would increase local imports by transforming high-value perishables into export crops that will be                      competitive in both domestic and external markets. Furthermore, they acknowledged that we would stimulate success for small                  and medium size enterprises by providing the information infrastructure and shipping solutions to enable their businesses to                 flourish. Each organization is committed to our cause and will continually support us by offering their expertise when needed.             </p>

            <p>Prior to our trip to Jamaica, we had a meeting with representatives of the Centre for Global Engineering (CGEN of University                  of Toronto) who expressed interest in leading the research and design of the ShippingHub Pods and Trailers, and the Big Data                  technology. While we were in Jamaica, we met with representatives of two higher learning institutions, Mona Geoinformatics                    Institute of the University of West Indies and the University of Technology Jamaica, to possibly collaborate with CGEN. The                  meetings proved fruitful, as both institutions agreed to be involved. Furthermore, Executive James Moss-Solomon of the Mona                  School of Business and Management wants to send his students for a week-long internship to Canada to further understand the                  Big Data technology.</p>
