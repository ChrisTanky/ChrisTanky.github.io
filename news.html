                    <h1>Trip Report - Kingston, Jamaica - July, 2014</h1>

                    <h4>Posted July 21, 2014</h4>

                    <p id="newsContent">We had a very successful business trip
                    to Kingston, Jamaica (July 9 - July 18).<br>
                    <br>
                    On July 9th, 2014, we arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, to
                    begin our string of meetings with ministries, private
                    sector organizations, and higher learning institutions. Our
                    primary objective was to receive feedback on the
                    ShippingHub National Logistic Strategy (SNLS) and to
                    receive their official support via written endorsements. We
                    are delighted to report that our trip was an astounding
                    success, going beyond our objectives.<br>
                    <br>
                    Both the ministries and private sector organizations agreed
                    to officially support us with written endorsements. They
                    believe the National Logistic Strategy will address many of
                    the challenges that plague Jamaicaâ€™s economy. These
                    difficulties include lack of domestic imports, lack of
                    exports, perishable crops, and inefficient infrastructure.
                    They recognized that our innovative technology would
                    increase local imports by transforming high-value
                    perishables into export crops that will be competitive in
                    both domestic and external markets. Furthermore, they
                    acknowledged that we would stimulate success for small and
                    medium size enterprises by providing the information
                    infrastructure and shipping solutions to enable their
                    businesses to flourish. Each organization is committed to
                    our cause and will continually support us by offering their
                    expertise when needed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to our trip to Jamaica, we had a meeting with
                    representatives of the Centre for Global Engineering (CGEN
                    of University of Toronto) who expressed interest in leading
                    the research and design of the ShippingHub Pods and
                    Trailers, and the Big Data technology. While we were in
                    Jamaica, we met with representatives of two higher learning
                    institutions, Mona Geoinformatics Institute of the
                    University of West Indies and the University of Technology
                    Jamaica, to possibly collaborate with CGEN. The meetings
                    proved fruitful, as both institutions agreed to be
                    involved. Furthermore, Executive James Moss-Solomon of the
                    Mona School of Business and Management wants to send his
                    students for a week-long internship to Canada to further
                    understand the Big Data technology.</p>
